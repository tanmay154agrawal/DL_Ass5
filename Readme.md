## DCGAN for EMNIST Dataset
This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using PyTorch, trained on the EMNIST (Extended MNIST) dataset. The code includes a script for training the model, as well as utilities for visualizing the generated images and saving the trained model.
```git clone https://github.com/tanmay154agrawal/DL_Ass5.git```
In this repository, we've explored how to train a DCGAN on the EMNIST dataset using PyTorch. You should be able to train and visualize the model, and generate high-quality images of handwritten digits from the EMNIST dataset. With further experimentation and tuning, you can explore the potential of generative models for a wide range of applications and use cases.

### Style GAN
This repository contains an implementation of StyleGAN using PyTorch, trained on a custom dataset. The code includes a script for generating images using the trained model, as well as utilities for visualizing the generated images and saving the trained model.
```git clone https://github.com/tanmay154agrawal/DL_Ass5.git```
#### Dependency
```!pip install ninja```
### Interpolation
Install all dependency given in the .ipynb file.\
Create a folder named "Frames" in your current directory.\
The interpolated images will be stored at this location.\
After performing feature disentanglement and linear interpolation between the facial features of two input images, you should be able to see a set of high-quality intermediate images that smoothly transition between the two faces. The quality and realism of the images may depend on a variety of factors, including the specific architecture and hyperparameters of the StyleGAN, the quality of the input images, and the accuracy of the feature disentanglement process.
